    <h1>Windows port</h1>

    <p>
      There is no official Windows port of mincrypt available yet but if you want to write the Windows port
      we would appreciate it. We would prefer to use mingw32 cross-compile from Linux systems to compile the application
      for Windows however if you want to do your development on your Windows box using some other tools that is using
      MingW32 (e.g. Dev C++) feel free to use it as long as it's free.</p>
