    <h1>Windows port</h1>

    <p>
      At the end of March 2011 the initial (first) version of Windows port has been introduced in the commits by minCrypt's
      author however only the console mode application is available, i.e. no GUI support yet for neither Linux nor Windows.
      <br />
      The Windows port is written using mingw32-gcc cross-compiler and developer on the Linux box with testing in both Wine
      emulator and also Windows XP x86 virtual machine. If you would like to contribute to project of porting minCrypt onto
      Windows platform feel free to use either mingw32-gcc cross-compiler from Linux (preferred way) or MingW32 based tools
      on the Windows stack, like Dev-C++. Feel free to adopt and use any development tools for the development as long as
      the tool stack is available for free.</p>
