    <h1>Contacting the development team</h1>

    <p>
      Since the MinCrypt project is developer and maintained by it's original author only, Michal Novotny, and it's
      presented on the github the best way to contact him is to write him a private e-mail to
      <a href="mailto:mignov@gmail.com">mignov@gmail.com</a> and prepend the <i>mincrypt</i> string to the e-mail
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use this e-mail to send patches for the project as mentioned on the <a href="contributions.html">Contributions</a> page.
