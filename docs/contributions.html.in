    <h2><a name="hacking">Hacking mincrypt</a></h2>

    <p>
      If you want to implement new features to mincrypt or fix some bugs you have found you can download the source from
      our GIT repository using</p>
      <pre>git clone git://github.com/MigNov/minCrypt.git</pre>
    <p>
      Please make sure you're using the coding style in which the code is already written (beware of spaces instead of tabs etc).
      When you have the patch prepared please send us the patch using the procedure mentioned in <a href="#sending">Sending patches</a> paragraph.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="sending">Sending patches</a></h2>
    <p>If you would like to contribute to the libvirt-php project you could write patches for it but please make sure you're following the procedure below:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>Set your git username and e-mail and also set the subject prefix in the project's repository using:
     <pre>git config --local format.subjectprefix "mincrypt"</pre>

 </li><li>Create the patch in the form of the commits and include also information about usage (example source codes maybe) and testing</li><li>Format it using <code>git format-patch -X</code> where X is the number of patch parts to be posted, for multipart patch (X is greater than 1) please use also numbering (-n) option and include the cover-letter (--cover-letter).</li><li>Send to my e-mail address mignov@gmail.com using your favourite e-mail client and prepend the <i>mincrypt: </i> prefix to the e-mail. Since my private e-mail account is being hosted on Gmail the <code>git send-email &lt;files&gt; --to mignov@gmail.com</code> command won't most likely work because gmail policy. &lt;files&gt; stands for <i>000*</i>, i.e. all the patches formatted by git format-patch since git format-patch names the files starting with the 4 digit numbers.</li></ol>
