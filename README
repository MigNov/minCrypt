 minCrypt application README
 ===========================

This application is the implementation of minCrypt algorithm as based
on the minCrypt design document written to provide simple algorithm
implementation on the minimum number of source files.

This approach has been chosen to be able implement minCrypt to as many
apps as possible using the minimum additional source files if the user
wants to put the encryption/decryption logic directly into the app,
i.e. not using a library version (although library version is part
of this minCrypt implementation) and using it is encouraged.

If you want to create the RPM packages for application the `make rpm`
and `make srpm` commands have been introduced to create both binary
package with the debuginfo version and the source package (srpm) for
Linux platforms. The Windows port of the library is not packaged into
any of those RPMs however if you make the package you can find
compiled Windows port in the ./windows subdirectory of the repository.

The algorithm has been implemented in C language with requirements
for math library (libm) and it's distributed under the LGPLv2+ licence.

Terminology
-----------

This app should be referred to as minCrypt.

Pre-requisite software
----------------------

Where versions are noted below these are the versions tested to definitely
work. For some of them you may be able to run with earlier releases, so
please report any success to the mailing lists

 libm
 php-devel (optional, to create PHP extension)
 mingw32-gcc (optional, to create Windows port)
